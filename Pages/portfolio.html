                <p>In our first-semester collaboration with Ellen Dalton and     Matthew Menchinton, we created a practical web design for MEC Photography to showcase our early web development 
                skills. The project involved building a five-page website, focusing on keeping the design consistent and original, while using HTML and CSS effectively. We made sure to incorporate the Box Model and added subtle touches, like the "bounce" effect. The result is a straightforward and user-friendly photography website that not only demonstrates our technical abilities but also shows our attention to visual appeal. This project served as a valuable learning experience, highlighting our capacity to balance functionality and designâ€”a crucial skill for future projects.</p>

                    <p>During my second-semester training at Keyin College, I completed a web development project focused on building a wildlife educational website.I chose a species, researched it using iNaturalist and other reliable sources, 
                    and put together the site with open-licensed materials from the web. All the copywright is original, and I made sure to cite my sources properly in the "about.html" page. I converted the text to HTML, making good use of 
                    HTML5 semantic elements. The website includes photos, videos, and audio for a more engaging learning experience. I also applied design using both provided 
                    style sheets and class-less CSS frameworks. This project reflects my technical skills and my ability to create a functional and visually appealing website.</p>

                    <p>Teaming up with my classmate Ellen Dalton for our inaugural React project was a rewarding experience. 
                    We crafted an interactive online bookstore that not only showcased a visually appealing catalog of books 
                    but also allowed users to explore product details, add items to a virtual cart, and smoothly check out. 
                    Navigating the complexities of React components and state management, we overcame challenges to deliver 
                    a user-friendly and responsive interface. This project not only deepened our technical skills but also 
                    strengthened our collaborative and communication abilities, laying a solid foundation for future web 
                    development endeavors.</p>

                In the creation of Buyify, my classmates Ellen Dalton, Ethan Miller, and I leveraged our collective JavaScript skills to craft a robust e-commerce platform. Using React, we structured the app with modular components like ProductList, ProductDetails, ShoppingCart, and Checkout. This ensured smooth integration, creating a responsive and interactive interface. We utilized React Router for seamless navigation between pages, enhancing the overall user experience. Additionally, we improved our skills in asynchronous programming and data handling by creating a custom hook for efficient data fetching from the chosen API. This project not only demonstrates our expanded knowledge of JavaScript and React but also reflects our commitment to best practices in web development.
